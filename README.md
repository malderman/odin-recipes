Project: Create a recipe bank including description, image, ingredients, and steps.

Description

Display categories of recipe links on homepage including Main Dishes, Side 
Dishes, and Condiments. Selecting a specific recipe link activates that specific 
recipe page. Once selected, the recipe's image, description, ingredients, and steps 
are displayed on a new page. 

The recipe's image will display on the left-side at the top of the page with 
the text wrapping to its right. The image is rescaled to 500px wide and has a 
5px-sized dark border.

The ingredients are listed using an 'unordered list'; and, the steps are listed
using an 'ordered list.'

The embedded links were the most challenging. Each of the four original recipes 
is linked to at least one other recipe.
