    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The magic ingredient in this chipotle sauce? Tahini. A paste made 
        of sesame seeds, typically used in Middle Eastern or Mediterranean 
        dishes, Tahini is perfect for making creamy sauces for salads and 
        tacos; but, it’s also fantastic for desserts like cookies or as a 
        replacement for peanut butter for peanut allergies. We use it in 
        many of our vegan recipes as a creamy alternative to dairy.</p>
    <p>In this sauce, we’ve called for only 1 teaspoon of adobo sauce. You 
        can freeze the remainder of the chipotle chile in adobo sauce for 
        future use. </p>
    <p>Ingredients ready? Simply mix all of the chipotle sauce ingredients 
        together in a bowl and you’re good to go! Here are a few tips:
        <ul>
            <li>The consistency of tahini brands differs. So, your sauce may 
                need a little more tahini or a little more water or lemon 
                juice to get to the right consistency.</li>
            <li>Store refrigerated, then warm to room temp. You’ll need to 
                store the homemade chipotle sauce in an airtight container 
                in the fridge. Tahini tends to solidify when chilled. If 
                it seems a little thick when you take it out of the fridge, 
                let it sit on the counter for a few minutes before serving. </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>This chipotle sauce is vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, 
        plant-based, dairy-free, and refined sugar free.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon or 2 limes, enough for 3 tablespoons juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tahini</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Mexican hot sauce (Cholula)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon adobo sauce (from 1 can of chipotle chiles in adobo sauce)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Juice the lemon or limes.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together all ingredients. Since the consistency 
            of tahini brands can vary, add a little more tahini if the consistency 
            of the sauce is too runny, or a little water or extra lemon juice if 
            the consistency is too thick. Store refrigerated.</li>
    </ol>
