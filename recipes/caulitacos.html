    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The star of these easy cauliflower tacos is our Crispy Breaded 
        Cauliflower. It’s roasted in the oven and covered in a savory, 
        salty, sweet and lightly spicy breading. It’s a bit of a play 
        on breaded fish tacos (though of course the flavor is quite 
        different!).</p>
    <p>Layer with refried black beans, tart cabbage slaw, 
        and cilantro. (We used canned refried beans.) Then cover it all 
        with the delicious Yum Yum Sauce. We used the sauce as a bit of 
        a “fusion” element to enhance  this vegan taco recipe. It’s so, 
        so tasty and adds an incredible richness to the tacos, a little 
        goes a long way here!</p>
    <p>Vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, refined sugar free, and naturally 
        sweet. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            Crispy Breaded Cauliflower</a></li>
        <li>15-ounce can vegetarian refried beans (or Easy Refried

        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>2 cups red cabbage, shredded</li>
        <li>2 limes (1 for the cabbage & 1 to serve)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons <a class="no-margin" href="./yumsauce.html">
            Yum Yum Sauce</a> (use vegan mayo or substitute

        <li>8 corn tortillas</li>
        <li>Fresh cilantro, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the <a class="no-margin" href="./crispycauli.html">
            Crispy Breaded Cauliflower</a> (about 40 minutes total; 
            use the remaining time to complete the steps below.)</li>
        <li>If using purchased refried beans, taste and if needed, mix 
            with 1/2 teaspoon cumin and/or a pinch or two kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the cabbage, enough for 2 cups. Mix it with 
            2 tablespoons lime juice and a pinch or two of salt. Allow 
            it to stand at room temperature until serving.</li>
        <li>Make the <a class="no-margin" href="./yumsauce.html">
            Yum Yum Sauce</a>.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas, or char them by placing them on grates 
            above an open gas flame on medium heat for a few seconds per 
            side, flipping with tongs, until they are slightly blackened 
            and warm.</li>
        <li>Chop the cilantro for a garnish.</li>
        <li>To serve, place refried beans in a tortilla, top with cabbage, 
            breaded cauliflower, Yum Yum sauce, and cilantro. Serve with 
            lime wedges to spritz prior to serving. (If you have leftover 
            cauliflower, you can reheat them in a 350F oven for 10 minutes, 
            flipping once.)</li>
    </ol>
