    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This crispy breaded cauliflower is salty, tangy, sweet, spicy, 
        and crunchy all at once! It’s 100% plant based and 100% delicious. 
        It’s roasted in the oven and covered in a savory, 
        salty, sweet and lightly spicy breading. It’s a bit of a play 
        on breaded fish tacos (though of course the flavor is quite 
        different!).</p>
    <p>A few notes on the basic concept here. When you cut the cauliflower, 
        make sure to cut it into large florets to make them easy to bake. 
        Then, instead of mixing the cauliflower with olive oil like a typical 
        roasted cauliflower recipe, mix it with a heated mixture of peanut 
        butter, soy, maple, and hot sauce, which helps the breading to stick. 
        Then, add the breading: panko, cornmeal, and a bunch of spices. 
        Using cornmeal gives a big crunch to the cauliflower.</p>
    <p>After baking 30 minutes in a hot oven, it’s good to go! The cauliflower 
        is best right out of the oven — though it still tastes crunchy after 
        sitting for a while at room temperature. If you refrigerate the 
        leftovers, the moisture in the refrigerator will take away the crunch.</p>
    <p>OK, now the question: how to serve it? Try <a class="no-margin"

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium head cauliflower (about 2 pounds whole)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup panko breadcrumbs (use gluten free panko as necessary)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon refined coconut oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peanut butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari or coconut aminos)</li>
        <li>1/2 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400F.</li>
        <li>Chop the cauliflower into large florets. Place them in a 
            large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix together the panko, cornmeal, cumin, 
            smoked paprika, garlic powder, turmeric, and kosher salt.</li>
        <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the coconut 
            oil, peanut butter, maple syrup, soy sauce, and hot sauce until 
            fully combined and slightly darkened, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the 
            sauce onto the cauliflower and stir several times until the 
            cauliflower is well coated.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/3 of the dry mixture into the bowl with the 
            cauliflower and mix. Repeat twice to stir in the remaining 
            dry mixture to coat all of the cauliflower. Then remove the 
            breaded cauliflower from the bowl with your hands and place it 
            onto a parchment lined baking sheet. About 1/2 of the crumbs 
            will remain in the bowl; you can discard these.</li>
        <li>Bake the cauliflower for 30 minutes total, flipping the 
            cauliflower with a spatula at the 15 minute mark. Serve 
            immediately. If serving as an appetizer, you could add a drizzle 
            of <a class="no-margin" href="./yumsauce.html">Yum Yum Sauce</a> or 
            another sauce. Or, kids love them with ketchup! (If you have 
            leftovers, you can store them refrigerated and then reheat them 
            in a 350F oven on a parchment lined baking sheet for about 10 
            minutes, flipping once.)</li>
    </ol>
