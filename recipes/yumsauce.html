    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Warning: this sauce is not quite a health food! HOWEVER, it’s a tasty 
        way to amp up flavor and a little goes a very long way!</p>
    <p>I wish I could share some deep secrets about how to make Yum Yum sauce. 
        But, it’s so simple: throw the ingredients in a bowl and stir! Yes, 
        it’s that easy. </p>
    <p>Now, about the ingredients. It’s a mayonnaise-based sauce, with melted 
        butter and tomato paste (or ketchup). We experimented with removing the 
        butter in this one, but it tasted very strongly of mayo. Adding the 
        butter helps to smooth out the sauce, so we would not suggest omitting 
        it. Also, Yum Yum sauce typically calls for sugar, but we substituted 
        it with maple syrup to keep it naturally sweet. Round it out with some 
        garlic powder and paprika, and it’s done! Delicious and truly easy. </p>
    <p>If you’d like to add a smoky flair, try using smoked paprika. It adds a 
        complex undertone that’s a nice touch. </p>
